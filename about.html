    <h1>What We Do</h1>
      <p> We strive to help the homeless in as many ways as we can. From donating to charity to helping out at shelters, we do as much as we can. We think that the homeless matters, too. They are not just unimportant people that don't matter, they are people, too. Just like you and me. We try to get people to donate. The reason people don't donate is because people fake being homeless to get money, that is just terrible. But even if you think they are homeless, you should still donate anyway, you will feel a better person afterwards.</p>
    <h1>About the Game</h1>
      <p> We take charity to the next level! Haha, get it, next level, this is a game, hahahaha PUNS! Anyways,this game should teach you about how hard the life of a homeless person is. It will take you through the life of a homeless person. When you beat the game, you might feel sorry for them and should go to our donate page and donate to one of the shelters listed there. </p>
        <p> This is a 'choose your own adventure' style game with many differant paths. You have to try to get the player, 'Tim,' to the homeless shelter at the end of the game. There will be risk, danger, and adventure. One thing is for sure, you might never have the same path twice.</p>
